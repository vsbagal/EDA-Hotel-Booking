The dataset also includes information on cancellations and no-shows.\n",

What factors are most strongly associated with cancellations?Are there any patterns in the data that suggest certain types of guests are more likely to cancel or no-show?The EDA will begin with a data cleaning process, where missing or erroneous data will be identified and addressed. The data will then be explored through a variety of visualizations, including scatter plots, histograms, and heatmaps, to identify patterns and relationships in the data.\n",

This report will be useful for stakeholders such as hotel managers, who can use the insights gained to improve their operations and make data-driven decisions."

It is also useful when dealing with large data sets (greater than 100 observations). It can help detect any unusual observations (outliers) or any gaps in the data.
